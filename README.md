# Calender-Dashboard

I track my thesis study sessions with google calender. All corresponding events have the title "Thesis". 

I build this chrome extension to evaluate via Google Calender API my investments, so I can check if I am on track:

If you want to reuse my code, you need an api-key and a client-id for your extension. 
You get both here: https://console.cloud.google.com/
